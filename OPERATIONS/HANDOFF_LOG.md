# Colattao Rush Handoff Log

## 2026-06-11 16:58:54 -04:00 IN
- did: Checked in for Kitchen copy preservation and grammar/clarity edits.
- state: `OPERATIONS/HANDOFF_LOG.md` did not exist before this session; existing repo handoff file is `HANDOFF.md`.
- next: Update only requested Kitchen item descriptions in `src/data/colattaoMenu.ts`; preserve item names, prices, layout, styling, routes, and game banner.
- blocked: None for local copy edit; live publish still requires explicit approval if pushing to prod.

## 2026-06-11 17:00:12 -04:00 OUT
- did: Updated California Sandwich description only; verified Cubano, Chicken Apricot, Montecristo, Pesto Mozzarella, and Ham & Cheesy text.
- state: Local diff is limited to `src/data/colattaoMenu.ts` plus this requested handoff log; unrelated penalty-game working-tree changes were not touched.
- next: Publish/merge to live Vercel only after explicit prod approval.
- blocked: Live Vercel publish not performed in this session.
